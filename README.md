## Differental_Breaking_With_Lever

This is an attempt to use any joystick axis as a break lever in combination with VKB T-Rudders Mk.IV Rudder Pedals. They are rudder pedals without toe brakes.

### Design Choices
1. Must be able to apply full braking when rudder pedals are centered.
2. Ideally, total braking force across the plane must remain constant. This conflicts with the first one.
    - A possible solution might be to maintain balance up to 50% total braking and then push to full braking after that. Knowing that 50% braking would give max ground steering authority.
